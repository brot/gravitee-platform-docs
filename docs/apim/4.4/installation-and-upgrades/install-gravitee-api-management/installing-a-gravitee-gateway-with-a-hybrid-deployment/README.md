# Installing a Gravitee Gateway with a Hybrid Deployment

## Introduction to Hybrid Deployments

Hybrid architecture is the deployment of a Gravitee Gateway using self-hosted and cloud deployments.

The Gravitee Gateway hybrid deployment uses hybrid components to provide flexibility when you define your architecture and deployment.&#x20;

This page explains how to install a Self-Hosted Data-Plane in a Hybrid deployment, which consists of a SaaS Control-Plane and a Self-Hosted Data-Plane. The control plane signifies the Bridge and the data-plane signifies the Gateway.&#x20;

The Gravitee Gateway needs the following two components:

* An HTTP _Bridge_ server that exposes extra HTTP services for bridging HTTP calls to the underlying repositories. For example, MongoDB and JDBC.
* A _standard_ API Management (APIM) Gateway. You must switch the default repository plugin to the bridge repository plugin.

### Before you begin

* Ensure that you understand the various components of a Hybrid deployment. For more information about the components of a Hybrid architecture, see [Components of Hybrid architecture](./#components-of-hybrid-architecture).
* Ensure that the Bridge and Gateway versions that you use for your Hybrid deployment are compatible. For more information about Gateway and Bridge compatibility versions, see [Gateway and Bridge compatibility versions](gateway-and-bridge-compatibility-versions.md).

## Components of Hybrid Architecture

The components of a Hybrid architecture are divided into two parts:

* [SaaS Control-Plane components](./#saas-components)
* [Self-hosted Data-Plan components ](./#on-prem-private-cloud-components)

## Installation Options

You can install a Gravitee Gateway using the following Hybrid deployment methods:
