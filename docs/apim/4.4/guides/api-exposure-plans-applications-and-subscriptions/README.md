# API Exposure: Plans, Applications, & Subscriptions

Gravitee APIM uses plans, applications, and subscriptions to govern API exposure. A published Gateway API is visible in the Developer Portal but cannot be consumed without a published plan. A Keyless plan can be consumed immediately, but all other authentication types require the API consumer to register an application and subscribe to a published plan. This system promotes granular control over API access.
