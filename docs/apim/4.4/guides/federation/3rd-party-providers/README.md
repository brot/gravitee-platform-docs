**Tech Preview**

Federated APIs are a Tech Preview feature and are not recommended for usage in production environments. If you are interested in trying our Gravitee Federated API Management, we highly recommend:

* Customers to reach out to their CSM or CSA
* Non-customers to [book some time](https://www.gravitee.io/demo) with a Gravitee Engineer for a demo and/or free POC



Gravitee does not provide formal support for tech preview features. Service-level agreements do not apply for tech preview features, and the use of tech preview features in production is at the sole risk and discretion of the customer.
{% endhint %}

There is a dedicated integration for each 3rd-party API gateway or event broker whose APIs can be federated into Gravitee. The user can load one or more integration plugins into an agent to create federated APIs. The details of each provider integration are linked below.
