# Federation

## Introduction

Federation describes an approach by which Gravitee can unify APIs and event streams running on different providers into a single platform for simplified governance and an improved developer experience. The benefits of federation include:

* Providing developers with easier access to APIs that were previously inaccessible, and reducing time to access.&#x20;
* Providing developers with a single, gateway-agnostic developer portal to discover and consume APIs in a unified way no matter where they are deployed
* The ability to capitalize on existing gateway and broker investments
* Centralized governance, access management and usage tracking for API governance teams.
