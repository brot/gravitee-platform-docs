# Install With .ZIP

## Introduction

Installing Gravitee API Management (APIM) from `.zip` files is a straightforward process that can be completed in a few simple steps. This method is particularly useful if you have limited internet connectivity, need customization or control over versioning, or work in non-standard server environments.

This page describes how to install Gravitee from `.zip` files via prerequisites, how to download and extract the files, and necessary configuration steps. Follow the instructions below to set up a functional instance of APIM on your server and begin taking advantage of its robust API management capabilities.

* [Prerequisites](install-with-.zip.md#prerequisites)
* [Installations](install-with-.zip.md#installations)
* [Enterprise Edition licensing](install-with-.zip.md#enterprise-edition-licensing)

## Prerequisites

Your environment must meet the requirements below before you install any of the APIM components.

*   **JDK:** APIM Gateway requires at least Java 17. Download the latest OpenJDK [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/). You can check your Java version with the following:

    ```sh
    $ java -version
    $ echo $JAVA_HOME
    ```
* **MongoDB and Elasticsearch:** The default APIM Gateway distribution requires [MongoDB](../configuration/repositories/mongodb.md) to poll the environment configuration and [Elasticsearch](../configuration/repositories/elasticsearch.md) for reporting and analytics. Download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try#production) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
*   **Download the binaries:** Download the binaries of the latest/preferred 4.x.x from the [Gravitee downloads page](https://gravitee.io/downloads/api-management). For example, to download `graviteeio-full-4.x.0.zip`:

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```sh
    curl -L https://download.gravitee.io/graviteeio-apim/distributions/graviteeio-full-4.x.0.zip -o gravitee-standalone-distribution-4.x.0.zip
    ```
    {% endcode %}



    {% hint style="info" %}
    The archive includes the binaries for all APIM components. If you previously downloaded it to install another component, you do not need to download it again.
    {% endhint %}

## Installations

Install each of the following:

* [APIM Gateway](install-with-.zip.md#apim-gateway)
* [Management API](install-with-.zip.md#management-api)
* [Management Console](install-with-.zip.md#management-console)

### 1. Extract the `.zip` archive

Extract the desired directory from the archive and place it in your `DESTINATION_FOLDER`. For example, if you wanted the `graviteeio-apim-gateway-4.x.0` directory, then use the following commands:

```sh
$ unzip gravitee-standalone-distribution-4.x.0.zip
$ cp -r graviteeio-full-4.x.0/graviteeio-apim-gateway-4.x.0 [DESTINATION_FOLDER]/
```

### 2. Run APIM Gateway from the command line

By default, APIM Gateway runs in the foreground, prints its logs to standard output (stdout), and can be stopped by pressing **Ctrl-C**.

Run APIM Gateway from the command line as follows:

```sh
$ cd [DESTINATION_FOLDER]/graviteeio-apim-gateway-4.x.0
$ ./bin/gravitee
```

Once APIM Gateway is running, you will see the log.

### 3. Check APIM Gateway is running

You can test that APIM Gateway is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8082` on `localhost`:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/
```

You will receive a response similar to the following:

```sh
No context-path matches the request URI.
```

### 4. Run APIM Gateway as a daemon

To run APIM Gateway as a daemon, specify `-d` on the command line and record the process ID in a file using option `-p`:

```sh
./bin/gravitee -d -p=/var/run/gio.pid
```

You can find log messages in the `$GRAVITEE_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down APIM gateway, kill the process ID recorded in the `pid` file:

```sh
kill `cat /var/run/gio.pid`
```

### APIM Gateway directory structure

The `.zip` (and `.tar.gz`) package is entirely self-contained. All files and directories are, by default, contained within `$GRAVITEE_HOME`, the directory created when extracting the archive.

| Location | Description                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| bin      | Binary scripts including `gravitee` to start a node         |
| config   | Configuration files including `gravitee.yml`                |
| lib      | Libraries (Gravitee.io libraries and third party libraries) |
| logs     | Log files                                                   |
| plugins  | Plugin files                                                |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Management API" %}
The Management API includes nodes for both of the UI components (Management Console and Developer Portal). You must install the relevant Management API node before you can use the corresponding UI component.

This section describes how to install Management API and verify the nodes are running.

### 1. Extract the `.zip` archive

Extract the desired directory from the archive and place it in your `DESTINATION_FOLDER`. For example, if you wanted the `graviteeio-apim-rest-api-4.x.0` directory, then use the following commands:

```sh
$ unzip gravitee-standalone-distribution-4.x.0.zip
$ cp -r graviteeio-full-4.x.0/graviteeio-apim-rest-api-4.x.0 [DESTINATION_FOLDER]/
```

### 2. Run Management API from the command line

You start APIM API from the command line as follows:

```sh
$ cd [DESTINATION_FOLDER]/graviteeio-apim-rest-api-4.x.0
$ ./bin/gravitee
```

By default, APIM API runs in the foreground, prints its logs to standard output (stdout), and can be stopped by pressing **Ctrl-C**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both the Management API nodes run by default. You can configure APIM to run only one or the other, as described in the [Management API configuration](../configuration/apim-management-api/general-configuration.md) section.
{% endhint %}

Once the Management API is running, you will see the log.

### 3. Check Management API is running

You can test that your Management API node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8083` on `localhost`:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/apis
```

You will receive a response similar to the following:

```sh
[]
```

### 4. Check Developer Portal API is running

You can test that your Developer Portal API node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `8083` on `localhost`:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/portal/environments/DEFAULT/apis
```

You will receive a response similar to the following:

```sh
{
  "data" : [ ],
  "metadata" : {
    "data" : {
      "total" : 0
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Run Management API as a daemon

To run the Management API as a daemon, specify `-d` on the command line and record the process ID in a file using option `-p`:

```sh
./bin/gravitee -d -p=/var/run/gio.pid
```

You can find log messages in the `$GRAVITEE_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down the management API, kill the process ID recorded in the `pid` file:

```sh
kill `cat /var/run/gio.pid`
```

### Management API directory structure

The `.zip` and (`.tar.gz`) package is entirely self-contained. All files and directories are, by default, contained within `$GRAVITEE_HOME`, the directory created when extracting the archive.

| Location  | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| bin       | Binary scripts including `gravitee` to start a node         |
| config    | Configuration files including `gravitee.yml`                |
| lib       | Libraries (Gravitee.io libraries and third party libraries) |
| logs      | Log file location                                           |
| plugins   | Plugin file location                                        |

## Enterprise Edition licensing

To install the Enterprise Edition of APIM requires a license key.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For information on obtaining a license key, visit the [Gravitee pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Users can directly provide the base64-encoded enterprise license with the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.&#x20;

The default location of the EE license file `license.key` is the `GRAVITEE_HOME/license/license.key` directory. To override this with a different location, provide the absolute path to the license file using the  `-Dgravitee.license` property in the `gravitee.yml` file, e.g., `gravitee_license: /path/to/my/own_license.key`.

To locate the `license.key`, both the `Gateway` and `Management API` components use the following search sequence:

1. The component will first look for the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable
2. If it cannot find the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable, the component will look for an absolute path to the license file in the `license` property of `gravitee.yml`
3. If the license property is not set in the `gravitee.yml` file, the component will try to retrieve the key from the default location `GRAVITEE_HOME/license/license.key`
