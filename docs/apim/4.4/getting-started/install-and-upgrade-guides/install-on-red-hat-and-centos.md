# Install on Red Hat and CentOS

## Introduction

You can install Gravitee API Management (APIM) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, or Oracle Linux using the `yum` package manager.

{% hint style="warning" %}
RPM install is not supported on distributions with old versions of RPM, such as SLES 11 and CentOS 5 — in this case, you need to [install APIM with .zip](install-with-.zip.md) instead.
{% endhint %}

* [Configure the package management system (`yum`)](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#configure-the-package-management-system-yum)
* [Install APIM](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#install-apim)
* [Upgrade APIM](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#upgrade-apim)
* [Enterprise Edition licensing](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#enterprise-edition-licensing)

## Configure the package management system (`yum`)

Amazon Linux instances use the package manager `yum`. The steps below show how to use `yum` to set up access to Gravitee's repository containing the APIM components.

1.  Create a file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/graviteeio.repo` using the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/graviteeio.repo <<EOF
    [graviteeio]
    name=graviteeio
    baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/graviteeio/rpms/el/7/\$basearch
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1
    gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/graviteeio/rpms/gpgkey
    sslverify=1
    sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    metadata_expire=300
    EOF
    ```
2.  Enable GPG signature handling (required by some of Gravitee's RPM packages) by installing the following packages. In many cases, these packages will already be installed on your Amazon Linux instance.

    ```sh
    sudo yum install pygpgme yum-utils -y
    ```
3.  Refresh the local cache:

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```sh
    sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='graviteeio'
    ```
    {% endcode %}

## Install APIM

Choose to either:

* [Install the full APIM stack](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#install-the-full-apim-stack) (includes all components)
* [Install components one-by-one](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#install-the-components-one-by-one)

{% hint style="warning" %}
An SELinux configuration issue can prevent Nginx from opening on ports 8084/8085. To correct this:

1.  Validate that the port is not listed here:&#x20;

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```sh
    # semanage port -l | grep http_port_t
    http_port_t                    tcp      80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
    ```
    {% endcode %}
2.  Add the port to bind to, e.g., 8084:

    ```sh
    # semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 8084
    ```
3.  Validate that the port is listed:&#x20;

    {% code overflow="wrap" %}
    ```sh
    # semanage port -l | grep http_port_t
    http_port_t                    tcp      8084, 80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
    ```
    {% endcode %}
4. Restart Nginx

### Prerequisites

Before you install the full APIM stack, you must complete the following configuration.

1. Ensure you have configured your package management system, as described in [Configure the package management system (yum)](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#configure-the-package-management-system-yum)
2.  Install Nginx by running the following commands:

    ```sh

sudo yum install graviteeio-apim-4x
```

### Install the APIM stack with dependencies

The following command installs both the APIM package and third-party repositories:

```sh
curl -L https://bit.ly/install-apim-4x | bash
```

### Run APIM with `systemd`

To start up the APIM components, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start graviteeio-apim-gateway graviteeio-apim-rest-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Check the APIM components are running

When all components are started, you can run a quick test by checking these URLs:

* **APIM Gateway:** `http://localhost:8082/`
* **APIM API:** `http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/environments/DEFAULT/apis`
* **APIM Management:** `http://localhost:8084/`
* **APIM Portal:** `http://localhost:8085/`

## Upgrade APIM

For version 4.1.4 and above, you can upgrade and restart APIM to perform an `rpm` upgrade of APIM components.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Refer to the [changelog](../../releases-and-changelog/changelog/apim-4.3.x.md) to follow potential breaking changes.
{% endhint %}

The appropriate upgrade process depends on the type of installation. Choose to either:

* [Upgrade the full APIM stack ](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#upgrade-the-full-apim-stack)(includes all components)
* [Upgrade components one-by-one](install-on-red-hat-and-centos.md#upgrade-components-one-by-one)

### Upgrade the full APIM stack

To upgrade your APIM installation, perform the package upgrade, then restart APIM:

```sh
sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-4x
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-apim-gateway graviteeio-apim-rest-api nginx
```

### Upgrade components one-by-one

To upgrade an APIM component, you can perform a `yum` upgrade and restart APIM.

*   **Upgrade the APIM Gateway package:**

    ```sh
    sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-gateway-4x
    sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-apim-gateway
    ```
*   **Upgrade the Management API package:**

    ```sh
    sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-rest-api-4x
    sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-apim-rest-api
    ```
*   **Upgrade the Management Console package:**

    ```sh
    sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-management-ui-4x
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
*   **Upgrade the Developer Portal package:**

    ```sh
    sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-portal-ui-4x
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

## Enterprise Edition licensing

To install the Enterprise Edition of APIM requires a license key.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For information on obtaining a license key, visit the [Gravitee pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Users can directly provide the base64-encoded enterprise license with the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.&#x20;

The default location of the EE license file `license.key` is the `GRAVITEE_HOME/license/license.key` directory. To override this with a different location, provide the absolute path to the license file using the  `-Dgravitee.license` property in the `gravitee.yml` file, e.g., `gravitee_license: /path/to/my/own_license.key`.

To locate the `license.key`, both the `Gateway` and `Management API` components use the following search sequence:

1. The component will first look for the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable
2. If it cannot find the `GRAVITEE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable, the component will look for an absolute path to the license file in the `license` property of `gravitee.yml`
3. If the license property is not set in the `gravitee.yml` file, the component will try to retrieve the key from the default location `GRAVITEE_HOME/license/license.key`
