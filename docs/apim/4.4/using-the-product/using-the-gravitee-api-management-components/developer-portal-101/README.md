# Gravitee Developer Portal

## Overview

The Developer Portal is a web application that provides a simplified, user-friendly interface tailored to the API consumption process. It acts as a centralized catalog where internal and external API consumers can find and subscribe to APIs that are developed, managed, and deployed by API publishers.

API consumers can easily discover and explore APIs, read documentation, test API endpoints, generate access tokens, view API analytics, and manage their API subscriptions in a single location. Additionally, administrators have significant control over the look and feel of the Developer Portal to deliver an accessible and on-brand experience to external API consumers.
