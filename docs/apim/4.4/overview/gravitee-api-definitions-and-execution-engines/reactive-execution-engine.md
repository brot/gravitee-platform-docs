# Reactive Execution Engine

## Overview

The reactive execution engine is based on a modern and fully reactive architecture. It enables an improved execution flow for synchronous APIs and supports event-driven policy execution for asynchronous APIs. Added features include native support for pub/sub (publish-subscribe) design and the capability to enforce policies at the message level.&#x20;

## Key improvements

The new reactive engine is designed to address a number of challenges associated with the legacy execution engine used for v2 APIs.

<details>

<summary>Policy execution order</summary>

Policies can be executed in the exact order in which they have been placed in the Policy Studio. This addresses a limitation of the legacy engine where policies interacting with the Head part of the request are always executed first, regardless of how they are ordered during the design phase.&#x20;

With the new reactive execution engine, it is possible to apply logic on a Head policy based on the payload of the request, e.g., to apply dynamic routing based on the request payload.

v2 Gateway APIs have this capability when [emulation mode](reactive-execution-engine.md#v2-gateway-api-emulation-mode) is enabled.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Policy isolation</summary>

Proper isolation between platform-level policies and API-level policies is enforced during policy execution. This ensures that platform-level policies are executed before any API-level policies during the request stage and after any API-level policies during the response stage.

v2 Gateway APIs have this capability when [emulation mode](reactive-execution-engine.md#v2-gateway-api-emulation-mode) is enabled.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Simplified scopes</summary>

Scopes have been simplified for API publishers by merging `onRequest` and `onRequestContent` into `onRequest` and `onResponse` and `onResponseContent` into `onResponse`. This means API publishers no longer have to define a scope in the policy configuration for v4 APIs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Async support</summary>

Message-based, asynchronous APIs such as Kafka, MQTT, WebSocket, SSE, and Webhook are supported.

</details>

## Policy support

The legacy execution engine supports all Gravitee policies that existed prior to the 4.0 release. These policies will continue to function without any changes to configuration or execution.

All policies will also support the new reactive execution engine, but not all policies can being applied at the message level. Whether a policy can be applied to v4 proxy APIs and/or v4 message APIs is detailed per policy in the [Policy Reference](../../reference/policy-reference/) Guide.

## v2 Gateway API emulation mode

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, emulation mode is not enabled for v2 APIs because it may cause unexpected changes in behavior. Please review this guide in its entirety before enabling emulation mode.
{% endhint %}

v2 Gateway APIs can be run in emulation mode:

Enabling this option allows v2 Gateway APIs to access the improvements built into the reactive execution engine. The functional benefits provided by the reactive engine are detailed in subsequent sections.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some v4 Gateway API features are dependent on the API definition, not the execution engine. Therefore, v2 APIs in emulation mode will **not** receive the following benefits:

* Event-native API management: Support for event brokers, multi-entry points, QoS, etc.
* Analytics improvements:
  * Message-level analytics with sampling
  * Ability to disable analytics in the API definition
* Modified flow execution phases: request, response, subscribe, publish
* Flow required match option
* Generic flow selectors
