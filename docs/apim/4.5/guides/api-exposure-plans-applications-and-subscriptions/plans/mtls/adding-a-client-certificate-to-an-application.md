# Adding a Client Certificate to an Application

To subscribe to an mTLS plan, the client must add a certificate to their application. To add a certification to an application, complete the following steps:

1. In the console, navigate to **Applications**, and then click a specific application.
2. For that application, click the setting the Tls Configuration. The client certificate is pasted in base64-encoded format.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Multiple applications in the same APIM instance must **not** share client certificates. You cannot save an applicationâ€™s configuration if the added client certificate is already present for another application.
{% endhint %}

When you add a client certificate to an application, the gateway adds this application to its truststore. At runtime, the gateway checks whether the truststore has a certificate that matches an application with a valid subscription for the API.
