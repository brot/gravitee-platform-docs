# Developer Portal

The Developer Portal is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface tailored to API consumption. While most features in the Developer Portal are also available in the Management Console (see the [API Exposure guide](../api-exposure-plans-applications-and-subscriptions/)), the Developer Portal allows consumers to easily discover and explore APIs, read documentation, test endpoints, generate API keys, view analytics, and manage subscriptions in a single location. Additionally, administrators have significant control over the look and feel of the Developer Portal to deliver an accessible and on-brand experience to external API consumers.

The following sections provide a detailed overview of the Developer Portal's features and functionality.
