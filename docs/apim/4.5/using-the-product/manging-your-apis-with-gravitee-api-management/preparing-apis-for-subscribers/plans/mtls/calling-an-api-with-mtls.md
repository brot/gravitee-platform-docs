# Calling an API with mTLS

## Before you begin

* You must have the client certificate
* You must have the private key&#x20;

## Procedure

* To call an API with mTLS, use the following command:

```bash
$ curl â€“-cert  <client.cer> --key <client.key> https://my-gateway.com/mtls-api
```

* [Replace \<client.cer> and \<client.key> with the name of the files where you have stored your client certificate and the file where you have stored the client key.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

Also, this requires that your client trusts the certificate sent by the gateway.
