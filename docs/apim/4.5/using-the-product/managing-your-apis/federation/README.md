# Federating your APIs

## Introduction

Federation describes an approach by which Gravitee can unify APIs and event streams running on different providers into a single platform for simplified governance and an improved developer experience. The benefits of federation include:

* Providing developers with easier access to APIs that were previously inaccessible, and reducing time to access.&#x20;
* Providing developers with a single, gateway-agnostic developer portal to discover and consume APIs in a unified way no matter where they are deployed
* The ability to capitalize on existing gateway and broker investments
* Centralized governance, access management and usage tracking for API governance teams.

If you're hosting Gravitee yourself, then Federation is **deactivated by default**. To enable it, please refer to the dedicated sections in the installation guide of choice:

* [enable Federation when installing with Helm on Kubernetes](../../../installation-and-upgrades/install-gravitee-api-management/installing-gravitee-api-management-on-premise/install-on-kubernetes.md#federation)
* [enable Federation when installing with Docker Compose](../../../installation-and-upgrades/install-gravitee-api-management/installing-gravitee-api-management-on-premise/install-on-docker/custom-install-with-docker-compose.md#enable-federation)
* [enable Federation when installing with .zip](../../../installation-and-upgrades/install-gravitee-api-management/installing-gravitee-api-management-on-premise/install-with-.zip.md#federation)
