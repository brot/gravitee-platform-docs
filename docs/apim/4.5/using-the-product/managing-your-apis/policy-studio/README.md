# Applying policies to your APIs

The Gravitee Policy Studio allows you to design flows, which are policy enforcement sequences that protect or transform how APIs are consumed. Gravitee offers a number of preconfigured policies, some of which are available in the Community Edition, while others are only available in Gravitee's Enterprise Edition.&#x20;

For more information about the policies and the policy studios for v2 APIs and v4 APIs, see the following articles:
