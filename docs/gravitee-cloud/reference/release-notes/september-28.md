## Hybrid Gateways

You can now, in a simple self-serve, manned deploy self-hosted hybrid gateways to your Gravitee Cloud API Management environments.\
\
Configuration will be synced securely from Cloud Gate components, and transactional analytics data will be sent from the gateway to your dedicated analytics index. So it can be viewed in detail in the API Management Control Plane Dashboard.\
